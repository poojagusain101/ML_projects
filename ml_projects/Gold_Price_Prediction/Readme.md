# Gold Price Prediction

A simple prediction system that predicts the price of Gold using machine learning, based on features such as price of SPX index and strength of EUR/USD forex pair. This system utilizes the Random Forest Regression theory for predicting regression data, and is based on the Gold Price Dataset in Kaggle.

**Random Forest Algorithm**

Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

Advantages of Random Forest Algorithm:

* It takes less training time as compared to other algorithms.
* It predicts output with high accuracy, even for the large dataset it runs efficiently.
* It can also maintain accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing.
