**Handwritten-digit-recognition**

Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset and using Convolutional Neural Networks in Python with Keras. This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. 

**What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?**

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can vary from person to person. Handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

**MNIST dataset:**

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.


**Requirements:**
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Seaborn

**Workflow:**

* Import the modules
* Load the MNIST dataset from Keras
* See the images
* Flatten the training data
* Create a simple neural network in Keras
* Evaluate the accuracy of test data
* Sample prediction
* Using confusion matrix for validation
* Using seaborn for confusion matrix
* Adding a hidden layer
* Evaluate the accuracy of the test set
* Using confusion matrix for validation
