**Diabetes Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) Algorithm.**

K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
it stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
it can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
It is also called a **lazy learner algorithm** because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.

In this project our goal is to Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
